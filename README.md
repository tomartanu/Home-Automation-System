# Home-Automation-System
🏡✨ Smart Home Automation System 🚀
Transform your home into a smart, efficient, and intelligent living space with this IoT-based Home Automation System! This project enables automated control of lights, fans, and environmental monitoring using ESP32 and various sensors.

🛠️ Hardware Components:

🔹 ESP32 Development Board – The brain of the system, enabling Wi-Fi connectivity

🔹 DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor – Monitors environmental conditions

🔹 Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) – Detects motion or object proximity

🔹 LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) – Adjusts lighting based on ambient brightness

🔹 LED (Light Emitting Diode) – Provides status indication and smart lighting control

🔹 Fan – Automated temperature-based cooling

🔹 Resistors (10kΩ) – Ensures proper circuit operation

🔹 Jumper Wires & Breadboard/PCB – For circuit connections and prototyping

🌟 Key Features:

✅ Smart Lighting – Automatically adjusts brightness using an LDR

✅ Temperature-Based Fan Control – Activates cooling when needed

✅ Motion Detection – Ultrasonic sensor triggers actions when movement is detected

✅ IoT-Enabled – Remote monitoring & control via Wi-Fi

✅ Energy Efficient – Reduces power consumption with automated scheduling


💡 Upgrade your home with automation – because the future is smart! 🏡🔌✨
